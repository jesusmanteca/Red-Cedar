## Description 

Red Cedar is an app that lets you create connected lists, like categories, products, and tags. Categories are universal, like "Shoes" or "Music". Products fall into a category in which one category can have many products, but each product can only have one category. Tags are used as labels and products can have as many tags and vice versa, tags can have or contain many products or no products. This app makes inventory easier to manage.
